This app will track flights for given destinations and update us via Discord at least daily.
We will be calling the Amadeus API to scrape flight searches and prices. This is a personal project for our personal discord.

# Features:
- Configure app for given date (span), Airport, and destination
- Post at least daily in discord app, possibly update if big drop in price
- Possibly track other prices of car rentals, hotels, etc.
